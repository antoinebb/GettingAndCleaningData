The purpose is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.




1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.




2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.




3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set




4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.




5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Go to your R console or R Studio

Then unzip the file and place your working directory  in the file "UCI HAR Dataset" that you have unzipped

So dowload the file run_analysis.R and open it in R Studio

So you can now run it 

At the end you have create  DataAverage containing containing the tidy dataset with the average for each Subject and each Activity , you have also create in your working directory the file "DataAverage.txt" containing all those data
